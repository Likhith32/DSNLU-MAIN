                                Intellectual Property (IP) is a creation of mind and it confers
                                right to the creator by the law towards the exclusive use of his
                                creation. Though this right is granted for a certain period, the
                                exclusive nature of it makes it significant. In India IP law has
                                undergone a significant change due to TRIPS, which has a direct
                                impact on legal regime pertains to patents, copyrights, designs,
                                trademarks, geographical indications etc. There is a close
                                relationship between IPRs and technology. The existing IP and IT
                                laws were amended from time to time to be on par with changes
                                technological changes globally. In recent years Intellectual
                                Property Rights (IPRs) and Technology Laws emerged as the most
                                important policy instruments. With its growing presence,
                                however, it has also been subjected to intense criticism.
                                Moreover, the structure of the institution itself has undergone
                                periodic changes with incorporations of newer subject matters
                                into its ambit. It is the endeavour of the CIPR&T to become the
                                beacon in the field of Intellectual Property Rights and
                                Technology Law by encouraging synthesis of knowledge and best
